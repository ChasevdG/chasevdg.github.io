    My PhD is in Machine Learning for Fluids and PDEs. Solutions to PDEs often form a low-dimensional manifold in the
    function space. This is because the solutions to PDEs are often smooth and have a low number of degrees of freedom.
    These low-dimensional manifolds are often approximated using machine learning techniques such as Galerkin Methods, Principle Component
    Analysis, and Autoencoders. However these techniques often fail to capture the topology of the system and the symmetries that entails.
    In other words, these techniques often ignore that the fluid is one, two or three dimensional or perhaps living on a sphere like ocean flows.

    My research aims to incorporate information about the topology of the system through incorporating geometric transformations into the representation process.
    The low order manifolds are often described by a linear combination of scaling factors and basis functions, such as the eigenvalue-eigenvector representation of PCA.
    While this representation works well for stationary systems, it often fails to capture interpretable dynamics for traveling waves.
    However, if we incorporate Euclidean transformations into the representation process, we can capture the dynamics of the system in a more compact and interpretable way.

    While this notion has been captured by previous literature, they often assume that the entire system is traveling at the same speed. However, in many systems, such as ocean flows,
    the system is composed of multiple waves traveling at different speeds. This is where the notion of local versus global equivariant neural networks comes in. 
    By incorporating local geometric transformations into the representation process, we can capture the dynamics of the system with more meaningful representations.
