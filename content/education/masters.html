    During the pandemic, I took online master's courses in AI adjacent topics from the University of Texas at Austin's MCSO
    program. After the pandemic, I once again transferred to the University of Amsterdam where I completed my Master's in 
    Artificial Intelligence in Oct 2023. My thesis, <strong>Lifting to SE(2) should be a piece of Cake</strong> supervised 
    by Erik Bekkers, Remco Duits and David Knigge, motivated Cake wavelets as an optimal directional wavelet for lifting 
    images to SE(2).
