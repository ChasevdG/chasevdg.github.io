                I started my academic journey at the University of Texas at Austin, where I studied Computer Science 
                as part of the Turing Scholars Honors Program. After three semesters, I transferred to the Amsterdam University College 
                where I studied Physics. While at AUC I did a semester of exchange to the University of Sydney where I took courses in Computer Vision. 
                I graduated with a Bachelor of Liberal Arts and Science Honours Degree in 2019 after completing my 
                thesis on <strong>"Bayesian Neural Networks for Learning the Schrodinger Equation"</strong>.
