              <p><strong>Clifford Algebra</strong> serves as a unifying language for
                <strong>rigid body transformations</strong>, and offers an easy way to express Poincare group transformations. At its core, Clifford Algebra is a
                generalization of the dot product and cross product which makes it a powerful tool for expressing the
                symmetries of physics. The ability to express physical symmetries is what makes it especially useful in <strong>robotics, game design</strong> and <strong>particle physics</strong>.
                However, I think it will also become <strong>key in creating interpretable and generalizable machine learning models across all physical systems</strong>.

              Clifford Algebra is a way of multiplying vectors and allows for the generalization of complex numbers and quaternions. 
              The algebra is simply motivated from two axioms : 
              <p>$$\vec{e}_i \vec{e}_i = \{1,0,-1\}$$</p>
              <p>$$\vec{e}_i \vec{e}_j = - \vec{e}_j \vec{e}_i$$</p>
              <p>
              Like in Linear Algebra, a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of basis vectors. For example,
              </p>
              <p>$$a = a_1 \vec{e}_1 + a_2 \vec{e}_2$$</p>
              <p>
              The geometric product between two vectors, is defined to be <i>bilinear</i> ie it is left and right distributive. Using this, we can show (right) that,
              </p>
              <p>$$ab = a \cdot b + a \wedge b$$</p>
              <p>
              Where the dot product is the inner product and the wedge product is the exterior product.

              The dot product, like in Linear Algebra, produces a <i>scalar</i>, whereas the wedge product produces a <i>bivector</i> which is a 2D object that represents a plane.
              The wedge product can be thought of as the oriented area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors as shown left.
              When the order of the vectors is switched, the orientation switches from clockwise to counterclockwise creating a negative in the equations.
              </p>
              <p>
              The wedge product is intimately related to the cross product in 3D space.
              In a 3D Clifford Algebra, a bivector can be uniquely identified with its (signed) normal vector.
              The cross product is precisely the normal vector of the plane formed by the wedge product of two vectors.

                The summation of these two products means that the geometric product can produce a <i>multivector</i> which is a generalization of a vector that can represent any dimension.
                If a bivector is multiplied by an additional vector, it produces a trivector which is a 3D object that represents a volume. 
                This can be thought of as the oriented volume of the parallelepiped formed by the three vectors.
              </p> 
              <p>
                The maximum <i>grade</i> of the multivector is limited by the dimension of the space.
                For example, in 3D space, the maximum grade is 3.
                Thus, Clifford algebras are often defined by the dimension of the space they are defined in, or more specifically by the number of basis vectors.
                A Clifford algebra, \(Cl(p,q,r)\) is defined by the number of positive (\(p\)), negative (\(q\)), and zero (\(r\)) basis vectors.
                The total dimensionality of the algebra is \(n = p + q + r\). 
                However, I will use purely positive bases unless otherwise specified.
              </p>
              <p>
                The total number of <i>blades</i> grows exponentially with the dimension of the space as \(2^n\). 
                For example, 3D space is given by 8 basis blades (See right).

                The even grades of a Clifford algebra are closed under addition and geometric product, ie starting with only even grade bases can produce only even grade multivectors.
                This means that the even grades form a sub-algebra of the Clifford algebra. 
                The even grade sub-algebra of a \(Cl(2)\) is equivalent to the complex numbers.
                Moreover, the even grade sub-algebra of a \(Cl(3)\) is equivalent to the quaternions in 3D space, as shown Left.

                Quaternions are a powerful tool in 3D graphics because they can represent rotations in 3D space without the <i>Gimbal Lock</i> problem that Euler angles have.
                In quaternion algebra, one can express rotations in 3D space using the <i>sandwich product</i> or <i>conjugate product</i>.
              </p>
              <p>
                $$\hat{v}' = \hat{q}\hat{\mathbf{v}}\hat{q}^{-1}.$$
              </p>
              <p>
              Likewise, the even sub-algebras of a Clifford algebra can be rotated with the conjugate product.
              In \(Cl(2)\), this results in a rotation in the complex plane, and in \(Cl(3)\) this corresponds to the quaternion rotation.
              </p>
              <p>
                More generally, the conjugate product of two vectors, \(-\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}\mathbf{a}^{-1}\) <i>reflects</i> \(\mathbf{b}\) across \(\mathbf{a}.\)

                Like the complex numbers, Clifford Algebra comes with exponentiation and a Fourier Transform and an Uncertainty 
                Principle. Making it also a powerful tool direction for extending signal processing more rigorously to higher 
                dimensions.
